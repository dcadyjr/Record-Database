# Project 3 - Crate

The goal of this project was to build a fullstack application.  Crate is a place where vinyl collectors can create a database of all the records they own.  I used the Discogs API using a Ruby wrapper to access information on releases from artists.

## User Stories

* Users create an account with email, password, and a screen name.
* Users login using their email and password.
* Users login and see the records they currently have in their crate.
* Users can search for albums by artist or album title.
* Users can see album covers and tracklisting for each album.
* Users can save an album to their crate for later viewing.

## Technologies Used
Ruby, Sinatra, ActiveRecord, Postgresql, Bundle, Angular 4, TypeScript HTML, CSS

## What is unfinished
* Preventing duplicate albums from being added to the database


## What would I like to expand on?
* Being able to sort your crate by Artist, alphabetically, release date.
* Making the search and detail views pop up as a modal.
* Being able to show a list view or thumbnail view.
* "forgot password" capabilities.
* Some sort of social aspect where you can have friends and view each others crates.
* User experience and styling.
* Being able to create multiple crates i.e, Jazz, Rock, Hip-Hop.
